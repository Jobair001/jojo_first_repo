              <p>
                MISSION!The word comes with a lot of challenges. If you think about web development, it's not only a single part. It has a lot of section to complete to make yourself as a web developer. Like,"HTML, CSS, Javascript, React" and many more. You have to finish every single topic to make yourself as a developer. On the other hand, you must have to a little knowledge about web design. Though CSS cover a little bit of design but it's better to know deep about design. <br>
                It's all about my challenges to make myself as a web developer. That's my 2022 Mission.
